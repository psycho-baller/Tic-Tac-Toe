different commands to play the game:

command structure: start {player1} {player2}
player 1 & 2 can be: 'easy', 'medium', 'hard', and 'user'

So for example: start user user:
this starts a game between 2 players

start user hard:
starts a game between u and the unbeatable A.I(I implemented minimax algorithm to achieve that)

to exit game just type in the command 'exit'
